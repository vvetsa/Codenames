This program is intended to act as a digital version of the board game Codenames. 

To play the game, just run the following in your terminal: $ python3 -m flask run 

To play the game, one person from each team is the clue-giver while the rest of each team guesses.
The clue-givers can see the cardtypes and give hints to try and gt their teammates to guess which cards are thiers.
To win, a team must guess all their cards or the other team guesses the death card.
If a team guesses a blank card or the other teams card, the other team gets a chance to give hints and guess.  

While playing in-person, it may likely be more enjoyable to use the physical board. 
However, this version can be fun over video call with one host sharing their screen.

The inspiration for this project came from playing Codenames with my friends over quarantine, with one friend having to hold their phone over the board.
I figured this project would allow me to create something fun and helpful.

This project was my first experience creating a web app from scratch.
